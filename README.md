## ðŸ’¥ Apliko: A TypeScript Discord.js framework targeted towards professionals

Apliko is a Discord.js framework aimed at ```making the work of professionals easier and faster```. It provides older implementations of Discord API components to make both implementation and execution faster. On top of that it uses a collection of applications to accomplish common tasks in Discord bots. These include slash commands, channel controllers, questionnaires, and panels. 

## Use Apliko in your project
Apliko has not yet been published to NPM so you'll have to add a file dependency. Simply clone this repository into a new folder, and add this line to your depdendencies in package.json
```json
"apliko": "file:path/to/Apliko"
```

## Plans
While Apliko is currently a Discord.js framework, we hope to remove Discord.js from our dependencies in the future so we can implement new Discord API features as soon as they come out, and continue improving the work flow of bot developers.
